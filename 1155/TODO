- eliminate data type "LibId", put range in "LibName"
[- don't use LibId/LibName as a key anywhere; instead, use the idIRI as a
   key; if necessary, create a "Map IRI LibName" or save the libName in
   the second component of a tuple; also make sure that IRIs are brought to a
   proper normal form after being parsed]
- get rid of libNameToFile; check each use and come up with an alternative
  (such as: libNameToSerIRI, downloading the file to hard disk, etc.)
- make sure .env files work
- when setting the logic in DOL, assume that logic (and serialization) as the
  default for loading ontologies
- make hets_cgi work (will probably do it myself, but need to talk to Christian first)
